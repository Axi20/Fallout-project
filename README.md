Magic Map

This is a WinForms application with a storyline similar to Fallout. There is a brief introduction to the story on the first page.

The application includes a map (created as part of a school project, representing my school), with several 'rooms'
that you need to enter to gather information about the system. The final room is the server room, and you must figure out how to gain access.
You should document the details you collect from the previous rooms. If you complete the form correctly, you will receive access
and find the secret message in the project's bin folder.

Note: There is an 'images' folder containing the map.
You may need to set this as the background for the 'Map' page.
You can open and edit the project using Visual Studio."
